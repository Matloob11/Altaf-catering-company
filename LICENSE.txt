LICENSE INDEX — Altaf Catering project

This repository contains two types of content:

     1) Template assets derived from the free HTML Codex template. These files
           remain under the original HTML Codex license (Creative Commons
           Attribution 4.0). The template license is preserved in `TEMPLATE_LICENSE.txt`.

     2) Project-original content (custom CSS, JavaScript, images you own, and any
           files you explicitly created). Those files are released under the MIT
           License in `LICENSE-MIT.txt`.

Files and ownership
-------------------
- Template files (keep attribution): see `TEMPLATE_LICENSE.txt`.
- Project-owned files (MIT): see `LICENSE-MIT.txt`.

If you want to distribute a single license to third parties (for example, to
give the whole site under MIT), you must first either (A) remove or replace
the template-derived files with original assets, or (B) purchase credit-removal
from HTML Codex. Otherwise the template parts must retain their attribution
per the Creative Commons license.

To remove the HTML Codex attribution legally:
     1. Visit https://htmlcodex.com/credit-removal and purchase the credit removal
           license for the template used.
     2. Replace or remove template files as instructed by the license terms.

If you want me to (choose one):
     - Create a repository-level `NOTICE` file listing which files are MIT vs template.
     - Replace `LICENSE.txt` with the full MIT text and delete template license (only if you own template or have credit removal).
     - Update the copyright holder string in `LICENSE-MIT.txt`.

Contact me which option you prefer and I will apply it.
